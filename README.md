This is a simple rating component challenge from @FrontendMentor. I have used: 

- HTML 
- CSS and 
- JavaScript with Typescript 

I am currently learning TS so using it is important, it was a massive challenge, I encountered a lot of errors but pushed through and its worked // save one error.

## Continued Development

- I currently have an error in the console.log related to an invalid DOM selection in regards to changing the colour of the label with the nested radio button, I will continue research and fix this error!

- Tailwind was something I wanted to use for this challenge, but its been a minute and I Was having an issue setting it up, so, I went with vanilla CSS and I will return to refactor this code. 

- Improve/refactor usage of TS. I did not utilize TS to its full capacity, I was learning with this project alongside the official docs, so, errors and very little optimization, so, optimization and cleaner TS code! Follow best practice, etc.
